-- Ark Game Engine --

To run the game engine, run the executable Ark_Editor.exe located inside Ark_Editor\Debug
Alternatively if you would like to create a game, use visual studio to open the solution and then
open Editor.cpp in the Ark Editor project. Within this file you will find the initialise function.
Feel free to modify this function to add different models/textures/components into the game.
